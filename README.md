## PyPaint 

PyPaint is a raster editor written using Tkinter library.

Here two versions of the program are present: PyPaint v2 and PyPaint v5.

PyPaint v2 requires only **Tkinter** library.
PyPaint v5 requires **Tkinter** and **PIL** libraries.

## Evolution program

This is a program that simulates a igenetic algorithm. It draws a grid of squares on which blue ones represent 'bots'. Each bot can move on the grid according to the code written in it. The code is represented by an array on numbers and it is the thing that evolves.

To run the program you need to have **Tkinter** library imstalled.
